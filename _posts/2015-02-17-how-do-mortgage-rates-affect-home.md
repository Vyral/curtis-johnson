Interest rates are volatile and can change at any time, but for the past year they have remained stagnant, right around 4%. **Recently, the FHA has lowered their mortgage insurance, making payments even more affordable for home buyers.**

This year, we are projected to rise by about 1% by the end of 2015. How does that impact your affordability? **Well, purchasing with a 5% rate as opposed to a 4% rate will increase your monthly mortgage payment by $200-300, while also adding around $12,000 to the total price of your home.**

Here is something most people don't know about lending: If rates go down, homes are more affordable and prices will go up because more people can buy, right?

Well, it's not quite that simple. **In the real world, lenders need to make money and when rates rise they see they can make more money from borrowers and are more likely to approve you for a loan.**
