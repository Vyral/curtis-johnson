A lot of clients here in Phoenix have been wondering what the most damaging mistake is when they go to sell their home. Is it not hiring a professional stager? Is it a failure to negotiate properly?

<div class="post-cta">
Buying a home? <a href="http://www.curtisjohnsonrealty.com/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a><br>

</div>

It's neither of those things. **We have found that the most lethal mistake in a home sale is thinking that there is a set selling price for a particular home.**

One way to sell a home is to price it low and have a buyer purchase it right away.

Another way is to expose it to different groups of buyers who will be willing to bid for the home if they find a great value in it. **This way of selling takes more effort, but also bring better results.**

**Every good agent knows that pricing a home correctly involves research, comparison, and a knowledge of your local real estate market.** Our team prefers to sell homes by driving traffic to a reasonably priced property, and this way we get buyers to bid up the price of the home incrementally.

Simply hoping for a good sale price is not a good strategy to sell your home. **We don't just sit back and let buyers come to your home, we find them and lead them directly to it.** We utilize a 168-point checklist to ensure your home is marketed well and is given the best chance possible to sell for a great price.

If you're interested in selling your home for more money here in Phoenix, please contact us. We would be very glad to assist you!
