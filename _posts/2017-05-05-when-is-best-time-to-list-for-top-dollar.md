When is the best time to list your home to get top dollar?

First, let’s cover the facts. We know that your home could sell for 11% above or 11% below its true market value based on how you handle 168 different variables. One of those variables is the time of year you put your home on the market. A lot of people will try and convince you that your home will sell at the same price no matter who lists it, whether it is staged or not, and whether you expose it to buyers online or not. That’s simply not true.

Nationally, the second quarter of the year is when the most homes are listed for sale. **The market here in Phoenix is a little bit ahead, so we’ve been seeing a lot of homes listed over the last few months.** However, each neighborhood's market is different. Some have values that are dropping because of high inventory, while many others have values that are spiking due to incredibly low inventory.

After 10 years of struggling in the market, there are a ton of boomerang buyers coming back into the market. These are buyers who may have been foreclosed on back in 2007 but are back and ready to buy now in a big way. There are also more millennial buyers coming into the market each year. **Put these together and we have more buyers coming into the market than we have supply coming on the market.**

If you want to know what’s going on in your specific area or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, I’d be happy to provide you with that information. Just reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
