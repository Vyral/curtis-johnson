What is the difference between a real estate team and an individual agent? Although there are some great single agents out there, real estate teams can give you a better experience.

When you buy or sell a home, does it matter if you hire a single agent or a real estate team?

There are some amazing agents out there in Arizona. At one point, there were up to 100,000 agents out there. In fact, one out of 83 people had a real estate license! Everyone had a friend in real estate. Some agents were able to do great work on their own, and there are a lot of great teams out there, too. **So what’s the difference?**

I’ve been in business for about 19 years, and for 13 of those years I’ve had some back problems. A couple weeks ago, I hurt my back even further and had to go on bed rest. **If I was a single agent, I’d be out of luck.** If someone wanted to see a house, there was no way I could have gotten up to show them the house.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the average agent only sells four or five houses a year. They won’t tell you that because they want you to hire them. They are trying to put food on their family’s table, but they have to juggle 168 different things to do so. Again, some of them do a great job.

Unfortunately, other individual agents are “also agents.” What do I mean by that? They cut hair and they’re also an agent. They work at Taco Bell and they’re also an agent. Even though some “also agents” do a great job, they just don’t have as much time to dedicate to you as a full-time agent or real estate team would.

I am a huge believer in real estate teams. During my first year in real estate, I worked over 100 hours a week. There were not enough hours in the day for me to do everything for my clients. **When you work with a team, you can hire 20 people for the price of one agent and get a better experience.**

Think of it this way: when you go to a restaurant, the chef cooks your food. If the chef also greeted you, took your order, served the food, collected the bill, and bussed the tables, your meal probably wouldn’t be so good, would it?

In fact, I just went to the hospital. If I had showed up and the doctor was at the reception desk taking calls and scheduling everything, I would be worried about having them take care of my back injury!

Real estate teams allow you to compartmentalize. My team has helped me sell 4,000 homes. We break up those 168 difference pieces of the transaction so that everyone on our team can be an expert at what they do. I hire and surround myself with the best in the business, and they do a great job!

If you have any other questions about working with a real estate team or about real estate in general, give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
