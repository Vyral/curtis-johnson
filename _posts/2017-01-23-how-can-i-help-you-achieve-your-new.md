Today, I want to share some thoughts on New Year’s resolutions. I also want to offer my help to your business.

Most people make resolutions at the beginning of the year. After all, now is a great time to reflect on our lives and see what we want to do to change them. Unfortunately, many people have given up on their resolutions by now.

If you’re still going strong, that’s fantastic. **Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you achieve your goals for 2017.**

Our team has some big goals and commitments that we want to hit this year. We want to sell homes and help families. Today, however, I want to ask about your business. Maybe there is something I can help you with.

I want to be the most referred agent in Arizona, and I know that means referring other people to you. I am happy to do that. After being in the business for over 20 years and helping more than 4,000 families, I know many handymen, cleaners, title companies, and lenders.

Even if you’re not moving, I may have a great resource for you.

As a business owner, you may need help with some repairs in your building or you may be able to help my clients. Our team has been ranked second in the state of Arizona, and that’s because we’ve done a good job helping so many great people and families.

I genuinely enjoy helping others, so give me a call or send me an email and tell me if there is anything I can do to help your business. I look forward to hearing from you!
