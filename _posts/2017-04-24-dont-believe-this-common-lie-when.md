What should you look for when selling? I’ll answer that today and go over how it ties into a big lie my mother used to tell me when I was a kid.

What does a lie my mother used to tell me have to do with what sellers should look out for when listing their home?

When my mother and I would go out to eat, she would sometimes reach over and take a bite of my food. She would say that those calories didn’t count because they weren’t on her plate. So, when I was really young, that’s how I thought my mom stayed so beautiful and thin! Later on I figured out that wasn’t true, and that calories did in fact still count if you took them from another’s plate.

In the real estate game, there are a lot of lies being thrown around. You’ll hear that your home will sell for the same price no matter who sells it. That’s not true! There are several different prices your home could sell for. There’s the value the appraiser comes up with, the value an online site like Zillow will give you, the value you personally think it’s worth, the value an agent gives you, and, ultimately, the value your buyer believes it’s worth.

{% include pullquote.html %}

So, how do you bring all those values together to decide what price you should accept for your home? I try to teach people about the 22% price swing, which means homes can sell for 11% below or above depending on 168 different variables that happen during the sale. People who don’t want to spend the money marketing your home are the ones that will tell you your home will sell for the same price no matter who sells it. Again, that’s a lie!

Right now we have incredibly low inventory, so selling your house won’t be an issue. However, you want to make sure you’re not walking away from a lot of money!

If you are looking to sell your home, or if you are looking to buy or have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’m more than happy to help!
