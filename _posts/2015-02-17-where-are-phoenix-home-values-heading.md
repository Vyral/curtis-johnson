One of the most common questions we get from Phoenix sellers is, "What are home values doing?" **Today, we are going to answer that question.**

First, let's look at the average sales price in the suburbs around Phoenix, and where they have gone in the last 3+ years.

**In 2011, the average sale prices in these Phoenix suburbs were:**

Chandler: $178,000

Glendale: $110,000

Tempe: $309,000

Paradise Valley: $1,114,000

As you may already now, home values have increased a lot in 3 short years. **Here are the current average sales prices for these neighborhoods, as of December 2014.**

Chandler: $265,000

Glendale: $182,000

Tempe: $371,000

Paradise Valley: $1,065,000

As you can see, nearly every market has seen exponential growth in home values in the last

3 years with the exception of Paradise Valley. **Luxury markets like Paradise Valley tend to not follow the same trends as your average real estate market.**

So, where are home values headed in 2015? If we look at national projections, homes are going to continue to appreciate in 2015 and 2016 by 3.7% and 3.2%, respectfully. **Phoenix will see appreciation anywhere from 3-5% in the next 2 years, which is a very healthy number.**

If you have any questions for us, don't hesitate to give us a call. **We would be glad to send you a market report specific to your neighborhood so you can get an even better idea of what your home is worth.**
