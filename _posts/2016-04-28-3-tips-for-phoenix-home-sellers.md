Many people think you can list at the bottom of the pile and get the amount you ask for. That’s not true. Fortunately, there are three extremely simple ways to sell your Phoenix home for top dollar and quickly.

• **Get a storage unit.** Don’t reduce clutter to only fill up your closets. Prospective buyers will want to see storage space, and it won’t leave a good impression if they’re already filled. It tells buyers your home is too small.

• **Utilize staging and photography.** We use professional photographers on site for 3D tours and more. Your listing should stand out among the competition. You need vibrant and bright pictures that show off your property’s best features. Nowadays, the first showing happens online.

• **Choose the right agent.** Many people assume their homes will sell effortlessly. That couldn’t be more wrong. You need an advocate to fight for your best interest in a transaction. Who you hire matters, as well as the type of exposure you get. For instance, we created our no-risk home sale program to guarantee the maximum amount of exposure.

If you’re interested in buying or selling a home in the surrounding area, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to answer your questions about this topic or more!
