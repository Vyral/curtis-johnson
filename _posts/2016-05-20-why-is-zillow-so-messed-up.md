I get the question from clients all the time: Why is Zillow so messed up? **Simply put, Zillow isn’t in the business of having current or even accurate real estate market info.** The company is interested in having eyes on their website.

When the public or real estate agents look at them as a place for accurate information, that’s when things get messed up. People think that they have **accurate information, and that’s just not true. If you go through and click on any of their information, they’ve got disclosures that say they could be as far off as 22%.**

{% include pullquote.html %}

**For Phoenix metro area real estate, I think they're about 6% or 7% off on average.** The average price of a house in the Phoenix metro is about $300,000. What if they’re off by 6%? That’s $18,000 you could miss out on when selling, and that’s a lot of money.

They make money by getting people to go to the site, and then advertising other real estate agents.

A price is a snapshot in time. It changes from day to day, week to week. It’s a fluid thing. **That’s why we teach our clients about the 22% price swing** -- 11% above or 11% below based on the choices that you make as a seller, such as pricing, staging, marketing, and the agent you choose.

Now you understand, Zillow might not be so messed up. They’re pretty great at making money, and that’s their business. If you’re expecting them to have honest and accurate data, leave that to a professional. I’d be happy to give you an accurate, professional perspective on home prices, so give me a call or shoot me an email when it’s convenient for you. I would love to hear from you!
