If you're hesitant about entering the real estate market this time of year, don't be. There are still plenty of people on the market, and they tend to be more serious this time of year.

Are you thinking about buying or selling a house this time of year? There are a few things to keep in mind if you're considering entering the market at the end of the year. People absolutely buy and sell houses at this time; in my 18 years of experience, I've sold homes on Black Friday, Christmas 'Eve' and New Year's 'Eve'.

What are the benefits of buying right now?

**Interest rates are still near an all-time low, so it's a great time to buy your first home or upgrade from your current house into a nicer one.** When buying during the holiday season, you actually separate yourself from the people who are just out casually looking at homes. You may even find that you have more free time around this time of year as well, thanks to built-up sick days or time off. Additionally, sellers who are on the market at this time are serious, so you will be able to find good prices.

Sellers can benefit from this time, too.

If you're just going on the market, it can be a bit tricky from a decorating standpoint. Decorating is not ideal because the first showing of your home takes place online. You want to make sure your house looks great with professional photography to attract buyers. Having decorations from Halloween, Thanksgiving, or Christmas in your photos can really date the photos. If your home doesn't sell quickly, you would probably need to re-shoot those photos down the road.

**The good thing for sellers is that the buyers out there are not messing around;** these are serious buyers. Buyer traffic may be down a bit, but the people who do come through your house are usually more serious. You won't have to deal with as much hold up from lenders and title companies, giving you a faster transaction as well.

Remember, buyers and sellers are still on the market this season every year. If you have any more questions or you're ready to buy or sell a house this fall or winter, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you!
